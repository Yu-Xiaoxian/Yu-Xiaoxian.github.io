This is my first blog using Hexo + GithubPage + Travis CI. Followed are my notes of this process.

# GithubPage

Github Page provides a platform to deploy your static websites.

# Hexo

Hexo is a framework to generate static websites from markdown files.

# Travis CI

Travis CI is able to build project online and deploy it automaticly, so you do not need to do it yourself.

Github Access Token is involved to make deployment safe.
